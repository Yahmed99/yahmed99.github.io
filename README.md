## About

Iâ€™m currently a senior studying Computer Science at Queens College. I am interested in becoming a full-time Software Engineer!  

- **What Iâ€™m into:** data science, automation, modifying games, and robotics.  
- **Fun fact:** In my free time, I like to modify my game consoles and install homebrew on them! My current lineup:
    - **PS4 Pro:** I use it as a living room gaming and streaming system. Homebrew allows me to install custom mods and overclock the system for better performance.  
    - **Nintendo Switch:** I installed Linux on it to learn how it works (it can also run Wii games).  
    - **PS Vita:** My main portable gaming device, also used for retro console emulation.  
    - **iPod Classic 7th Gen:** Upgraded to 500GB to store my full music collection.
